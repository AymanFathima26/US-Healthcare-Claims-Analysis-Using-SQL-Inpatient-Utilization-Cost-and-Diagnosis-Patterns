Project Overview 
This project analyzes US inpatient healthcare claims data using SQL to evaluate utilization, diagnosis burden, and cost drivers. The analysis simulates real-world payer and pharmaceutical analytics workflows commonly used in epidemiology consulting and RWE teams.

Key Objectives
Analyze inpatient utilization patterns
Identify high-cost diagnoses and patients
Evaluate length of stay and payment efficiency
Demonstrate SQL-based healthcare analytics

Data Source
CMS DE-SynPUF synthetic inpatient claims dataset (HIPAA-compliant, publicly available).

Tools Used
SQL Server / PostgreSQL
SQL (CTEs, joins, window functions)
Excel / Power BI (optional visualization)

Key Analyses
Admissions per patient
ICD-9 diagnosis frequency
Cost distribution and payment ratios
Readmission proxy analysis
Chronic condition cost stratification

Relevance
This project demonstrates applied claims analytics skills relevant to:
Epidemiology consulting
Real-world evidence (RWE)
Healthcare research & analytics roles
