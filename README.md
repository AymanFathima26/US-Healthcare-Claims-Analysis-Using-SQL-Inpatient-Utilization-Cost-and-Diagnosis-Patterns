Work-in-progress analysis of oncology healthcare claims, currently focused on Excel-based data cleaning and quality assessment.

🧬 Oncology Claims Analysis (Work in Progress)
📌 Project Status

Ongoing – Data Cleaning & Preparation Phase

📖 Overview

This repository contains an ongoing healthcare analytics project focused on oncology-related claims data. The current phase of the project involves cleaning, validating, and preparing raw claims data in Microsoft Excel to create an analysis-ready dataset for downstream SQL analysis and visualization.

This project mirrors real-world claims analytics workflows, where data quality and validation are critical before any cost, utilization, or outcomes analysis can be performed.

🎯 Project Objectives

Clean and standardize raw oncology claims data

Identify and handle missing, null, and inconsistent values

Validate payment amounts, dates, and claim fields

Prepare structured datasets for future SQL-based analysis

Document common data quality issues in healthcare claims
